            ^^^^^^^^^^
Error: This expression has type 'a Foo.t
       but an expression was expected of type ('b : '_representable_layout_1)
       The layout of 'a Foo.t is any, because
         a missing .cmi file for Foo.t.
       But the layout of 'a Foo.t must be a sublayout of '_representable_layout_1, because
         bound by a `let`. No .cmi file found containing Foo.t.
       Hint: Adding "foo" to your dependencies might help.

Error: This expression has type M.a but an expression was expected of type
         ('a : value)
       The layout of M.a is any, because
         a missing .cmi file for M.a.
       But the layout of M.a must be a sublayout of value, because
         imported from another compilation unit. 
       No .cmi file found containing M.a.
       Hint: Adding "m" to your dependencies might help.
